# Covid Situation Report (PowerBI)

## Intro

Since media channels are overflown with news on the COVID-19 virus it's harder and harder to see the forest from the trees so I put together my own Bi report. The report is mostly based on the "famous" dataset from the John Hopkins University and as such the data can be up to one day old.
